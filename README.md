##Comments

This assignment was pretty straightforward. I didn't have too many problems with it (as far as I know at this point).

The only thing I wasn't too sure of was the media tags in the HTML. Does the width indicated in the media tag in the HTML have to be a specific size? I indicated it to be significantly larger than the width values I put in my CSS. Is that the proper way to go about it? Any feedback is appreciated.  


Thanks for your feedback and efforts!
